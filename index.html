                        From hardware to mobile, there are so many fields to
                        explore! We want women to explore their ideas and interests, and
                        are looking forward to some amazing projects!

                        Right now, only 20% of hackathon participants are women. We hope
                        to fill that gap by providing a comfortable environment that is
                        focused on learning and exploring!

                        on a
                        project. You can attend workshops, hear from people in the computer science field and
